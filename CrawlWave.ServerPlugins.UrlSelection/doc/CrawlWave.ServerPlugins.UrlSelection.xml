            <summary>
            UrlSelectorPlugin is a plugin that selects the most appropriate urls to be crawled
            next, combines them with the robots.txt information stored in the system's database
            at the time of the selection and marks them as assigned.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The UrlSelectionPlugin in effect allows the selection of the next Urls to be crawled
            to be performed in batches. Thus the server spends much less processing time, since
            the selection of ready Urls is perfomed only when the number of pending urls falls
            below an administrator-defined threshold. Thus the processing required in order to
            assign urls to clients is very little, since the Selection process does not have to
            be performed from scrath. In other words when it is activated it builds a queue of
            ready urls that can be assigned to the clients very fast and whose size can be easily
            adjusted according to the load on the server and the number of clients.<br/>
            A good policy for selecting the size of the cache is to multiply the number of active
            clients by 10 times the number of Urls per packet (work unit), whereas the selection
            size (the number of Urls selected and marked as ready to be crawled) is 10 times the
            threshold (cache) size.<br/>
            Any algorithms effecting the way the next urls to be crawled are selected should be
            applied by this plugin. In other words this plugin sould take into consideration the
            priority of Urls during the selection process.
